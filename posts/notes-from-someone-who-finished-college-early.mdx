# Notes from Someone Who Finished College Early

College is a range of experiences and experiments. Many experience college over a period of 6 years (even for a 4 year degree). I'm gonna talk for a few minutes on my time in college, how I graduated "early", and ultimately why I chose to take this path.

## The How

What does it mean to graduate early? For me it meant taking on an accelerated program to get my degree faster. 11 hour school days, fast-paced curriculum, and tons of hands on projects were no stranger to me. I also managed to juggle full time jobs, friendships, and relationships between all of it. In all it took ~26 months to complete, and I graduated 4 days before I was legally able to drink (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).

## The Why

Time. Money. What is it that you truly value in life? When I share my deliberately shortened path with others many of them will write themselves off as if they neither have the capacity nor the capability to consume 4 years worth of education in just over 2. They're somehow convinced that I have something that they themselves don't possess. However, when I think back on how I accomplished this it becomes ever more clear why I did it was more important.

Why would I take on a path that requires me to sacrifice? More effort, more expensive, more stress, less free time, less leisure, less sanity. All can be answered by my previous question: What is it that you truly value in life? Time? Money? For me the answer was simple. My time is incredibly more valuable to me.

I could have spent 4-5 years in college, slowly but surely earning my degree. I could have spent less money. I could have had more free time. Instead I chose the fast track to get to do what I love to professionally.
