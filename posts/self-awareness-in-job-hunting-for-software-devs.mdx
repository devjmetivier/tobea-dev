# Self-Awareness in Job Hunting for Software Devs

Recently I've seen a trend of many software devs shifting across the software development job market as well as many new devs coming onto the scene looking for work. Now has never been a better time to be an office worker in general. The qualities of working online and (now) working from home have never been more attractive. The software development community has largely been in celebration of others achievements and successful transitions in recent months, and rightfully so. There is, however, an equally noticeable number of individuals not seeing the same success.

Take the example of someone being rejected for a job. There are many (and often multiple) reasons a candidate for a job might be rejected:

- Unqualified
- Lack of cultural fitness with the business
- Location limitations
- Compensation disputes

I could go on. The one trend that I notice with most of the instances I see of job rejection (especially on Twitter) is that they typically lack an effort of self-reflection, and even if it's there it's often a negative form of musings. Why is this?

There's certainly valid reasons to be upset about rejection of any form. However, there are ways to be constructive about rejection, and this requires an identification process.

- What are potential contributing factors to my being rejected for a job?
- Based on these potential factors, how can I identify the impact of these factors individually?
- How can I communicate and identify ways to either reduce these factors impact on my candidacy, or how can I swing the impact of these factors to be in my favor?

I want to focus on this last one a bit because communication is key to understanding - both internally and externally. Self-reflection is an important internal communication tool, but it's a half-baked solution when you're trying to influence outcomes for yourself in the present. Self-awareness, I would argue, is a key to influencing personal outcomes.

I want to be clear when talking about self-awareness. It's very distinct from policing ones self and actively changing personal behaviors. Individuals have and always will have qualities personable to themselves. They may not be particularly unique, but the preservation of ones sense of self is important and quite healthy. What I'm advocating for is a particular acute awareness to the inward and outward projections of ones self. A baseline establishment of ones self can allow you to more accurately identify ones features and more importantly - more correctly answer/solve the questions I just posed. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your behavior, but this awareness can allow you to more effectively position yourself to positively influence outcomes - whatever it is that means to you.

For those of you who have ever been rejected a job - Have you ever stopped and considered that it might be your shirt?
